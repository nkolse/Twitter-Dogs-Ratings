# WERateDogs Twitter Archive

The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about 
the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? 
Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good 
dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international
media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively
for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data
(tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on
August 1, 2017.

# Data Analysis and Visualization Report
In this section of data analysis and Visualization the analysis is 
to get the insights of the dataset to give more meaning. The visualization process
involved plotting of bar using matplotlib library to identify the popularity of the dog
stage. The following questions were used to guide in the achieving of the objectives.

1. What is the success rate of the three algorithms?
2. Which type of dog breed is most favored?
3. What are the top 5 popular dog names?
4. What is the Popularity of dog stage?
5. Which is most favorite dog in 2015, 2016, and 2017?

## Summary of Findings
The algorithms of rating dogs p2_confident has a success rate of 74.87% followed closely by p1_contident with percentage success rate of 73.91. The third algorithm p3_confident has a success rate of 72.30%. 
The most favorite dog breed is Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Pembroke, Chihuahua, Pug according to the p1_confident algorithm. 
The top five most popular dog names are Oliver, Turker, Charlie, Cooper and Penny, they both have an occurrence of 10 times.
In the WeRateDogs the most common dog stage is pupper which is followed by the doggo, the third in the popularity is puppo and the last one is floofer. It clear that the pupper will remain most popular even if the three other dog stages are combined. The bar shows the visual presentation.
